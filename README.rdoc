Rails version: Rails 4.1.4

This is the practice app created from the guide at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html.  I'm using this to learn Rails.  After trying to use the tutorials from numerous other sites only to discover that my version of Rails is newer and not supported by all of them, I realized that the best source to learn from is the original source: the RailsGuide.  It covers the latest version of Rails.  After creating this app, I'll move onto creating my own blog from memory and research.  Then I'll learn something else and keep repeating the process.
